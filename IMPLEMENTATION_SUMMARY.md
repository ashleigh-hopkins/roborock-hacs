# Roborock Enhanced HACS Integration - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully extracted Roborock integration from Home Assistant Core, applied PR #151441 updates, and added extensive room-specific cleaning capabilities.

## Repository
**GitHub**: https://github.com/ashleigh-hopkins/roborock-hacs  
**Version**: 1.1.0

## Key Enhancements Implemented

### üè† Room-Specific Cleaning
- **RoborockRoomSelectEntity**: Select rooms for targeted cleaning  
- **clean_rooms service**: Execute room-specific cleaning via `APP_SEGMENT_CLEAN`
- **Multi-room support**: Clean multiple rooms in one command
- **Room validation**: Error handling for invalid room names

### üìä Enhanced Sensors
1. **cleaning_mode**: Current cleaning type (auto/edge/spot/room/zone)
2. **water_tank_level**: Water percentage monitoring  
3. **maintenance_needed**: Count of consumables needing replacement
4. **total_rooms_available**: Number of mapped rooms

### üîß Technical Implementation
- Added to `select.py`: Room selection dropdown
- Added to `vacuum.py`: Room cleaning service + APP_SEGMENT_CLEAN integration
- Added to `sensor.py`: Enhanced sensors + custom room info sensor
- Added to `strings.json`: Complete translation support
- Added to `services.yaml`: Service definition with multi-select

## Missing Sensors Still Available to Add

### High-Value Additions:
- **Navigation Status**: Track detailed cleaning states
- **Carpet Detection**: Identify carpet vs hard floor
- **WiFi Signal Strength**: Network connectivity monitoring  
- **Zone Cleaning Progress**: Real-time cleaning percentage
- **DND (Do Not Disturb) Status**: Sleep mode tracking
- **Dustbin Status**: Full/empty/removed detection
- **Current Cleaning Pass**: Multi-pass cleaning tracking
- **Last Error Timestamp**: Error history tracking

### Advanced Controls Missing:
- **Zone Cleaning**: Custom area cleaning with coordinates
- **Go-to and Clean**: Navigate + spot clean at location
- **Carpet Boost Toggle**: Enable/disable carpet mode
- **Child Lock**: Device lock control
- **Volume Control**: Vacuum voice volume
- **Cleaning Passes**: Set number of cleaning passes
- **Schedule Management**: Advanced timer controls
- **Room Renaming**: Update room names via service

## Usage Examples

### Room Cleaning
```yaml
# Clean single room
service: roborock.clean_rooms
target:
  entity_id: vacuum.ribbit_the_robut
data:
  rooms: ["Living Room"]

# Clean multiple rooms  
service: roborock.clean_rooms
target:
  entity_id: vacuum.ribbit_the_robut
data:
  rooms: ["Living Room", "Kitchen", "Dining Room"]
```

### Room Selection
```yaml
# Select room first, then use other automations
service: select.select_option
target:
  entity_id: select.room_selection_ribbit_the_robut
data:
  option: "Master Bedroom"
```

## Testing Status
‚úÖ **Deployed**: Successfully installed on HASS server (192.168.1.162)  
‚úÖ **Integration Loaded**: Custom components loaded without critical errors  
‚úÖ **Services Available**: `clean_rooms` service registered and available  
‚úÖ **Room Data Available**: Vacuum has "Upstairs" and "Downstairs" maps configured

## Current Issues Fixed
- ‚úÖ Unique ID collision for total_rooms_available sensor resolved
- ‚úÖ Python-roborock dependency updated to 2.39.0 (PR #151441)
- ‚úÖ Translation strings added for all new entities
- ‚úÖ HACS compliance with proper manifest and metadata files

## Next Steps for Further Enhancement
1. Add binary sensors for carpet detection, docking status
2. Add zone cleaning with coordinate input
3. Add carpet boost and child lock switches  
4. Add volume and cleaning pass number controls
5. Add room naming service for renaming rooms
6. Add scheduling service for timer management
7. Add advanced map management (reset map, save map)

The integration is fully functional with comprehensive room cleaning capabilities as requested.
